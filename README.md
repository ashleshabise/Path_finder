# path_finder
This simple python script is a simple application of Dijkstra's algorithm in IIT kanpur campus . The main focus of this program is to help the first year students to get around the huge campus easily using shortcuts. The script uses the famous Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path and then convert the result into user readable form and the directions are easy to read. 


# Prerequisites
Python 2.7 or above.


# How to run
Simple go into the src directory on the command line and do : 

<code> python route1.py </code>

This opens a User interface where the user can choose the source and destination and get directions in simple plain English.

The main challenge in this program was to convert the paths to readable form for the user. I included the above code for Dijkstra's algorithm since application was the priority.
